## Installation

#### Install locally:

```bash
npm install @eriicafes/reflow
```

And initialise:
```bash
npx reflow init
```

#### Or install both globally and locally (preferred):

```bash
npm install -g @eriicafes/reflow

npm install @eriicafes/reflow
```

And initialise:
```bash
reflow init
```

Global installation is preferred as reflow binary requires a local installation and will always run the locally binary when neccessary.
## Usage/Examples

Examples below assume you have both a global installation and a local installation, for local installation only you will have to prefix the command with `npx` ie:

```bash
npx reflow
```

or

```bash
reflow
```

All commands have a `-h or --help` flag to display a help message.
Nearly all commands have a `-d or --dry-run` flag useful to see the commands that would run without actually making any changes.
Command arguments in square brackets `[]` are optional while those in angle brackets `<>` are required.

### Initialise reflow workspace
```bash
reflow init

Options:
  -n --no-install  turn off automatic package installation
  --lib            initialize as an npm library
```

### Branching

create and checkout new branch

```bash
reflow branch [name] [parent]
```

rename the current branch

```bash
reflow branch -r [name]
```

### Checkout

```bash
reflow checkout [branch]
```

checkout with search on branches (this examples searches for all branches beginning with `feat`)

```bash
reflow checkout feat
```

### Merge

merge branch to the main branch (whether on the main branch or on the branch to be merged)

```bash
reflow merge

Options:
  --prefer-ff   always perform a fast-foward merge (default: false)
```

### Commit

```bash
reflow commit

Options:
  --retry     retry last commit attempt
```

### Push

push branch to remote (prompts to sets upstream if not available) \
force push is a bit less dangerous as the following flags are attached `-f --force-with-lease --force-if-includes`

```bash
reflow push

Options:
  -f --force  force push
```

### Release

make a release (bump version, tag commit and push changes) \
would usually only be run on a CI/CD pipeline except if `-f or --force` flag is used

```bash
reflow release

Options:
  -f --force      force release when not in a CI environment (default: false)
  -a --as <type>  release with a specific version type
  --no-push       prevent pushing changes and tags to remote
```

### Prerelease

make a pre-release (eg. v1.0.1-{tag}.0)

```bash
reflow prerelease

Options:
  -t --tag <name>  pre-release tag
  --as <type>      release with a specific version type
  --no-push        prevent pushing changes and tags to remote
```

for example if version is at 0.1.0 and we want to make a prerelease with an alpha tag and release as a a minor version:

```bash
reflow prerelease -t alpha --as minor
```
this will bump the version from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0-alpha.0


### Generate Files

type includes `configs`, `actions` and `hooks`, file is the file name, run the command without any arguments to see all possible files to generate

```bash
reflow generate [type] [file]

Options:
   -c --common   generate all common template files
   -a --all      generate all template files
```


### Actions (github actions)
When you run `reflow init` a `test.yml` workflow will be generated, which will run tests and build using `npm test` and `npm run build` respectively.
All actions are listed below:

- test.yml (run tests and build)
- version.yml (bump version and push new update with tags) requires a **VERSION_TOKEN** secret containing a Github Personal Access Token with repo permissions
- release.yml (triggered by version.yml workflow, creates a draft github release)
- publish.yml (triggered by release.yml workflow, publishes package to NPM) requires an **NPM_TOKEN** secret containing an NPM Access Token

All actions can be modified to as needed
